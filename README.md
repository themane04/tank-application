# Heat Calculator for Tanks

## Overview
This Java-based project features a heat calculation application for tanks. It supports different tank shapes, including cylindrical and cuboid, and calculates the required heat based on various parameters.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories:

- **models**:
  - `CuboidTank.java` - Defines properties and behaviors of cuboid-shaped tanks.
  - `CylinderTank.java` - Defines properties and behaviors of cylindrical tanks.
  - `Tank.java` - Abstract base class for tank objects.
- **tests**:
  - `CuboidTankTest.java` - Unit tests for cuboid tanks.
  - `CylinderTankTest.java` - Unit tests for cylindrical tanks.
- **utils**:
  - `ErrorMessage.java` - Utility class for error messages.
  - `Style.java` - Utility class for application styling.
  - `HeatCalculatorApp.java` - Main application class that runs the heat calculator.
